# CMIS 4920 Capstone: Kiczan Production Information System

This project utilizes a database written in SQL and an application with a user interface written in C#.
This goal of this project is to increase efficiency and productivity at Kiczan Manufacturing, by optimizing
the collection of work order related data as Kiczan Manufacturing receives work orders derived from customer
purchase orders. Work orders are stored as records within the database, and are retrieved by the user interface
application to assist department managers with the shop floor production process. Managers can retrieve records
utilizing a variety of search parameters, delete existing records in the event of errors or redundancies, add new records
upon receiving new work orders, and update existing records in the event of errors or other necessary scenarios.
